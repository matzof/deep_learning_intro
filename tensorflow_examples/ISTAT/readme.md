The data is downloaded from https://www.istat.it/, and represents the official yearly population data from 2012 to 2018. 

The features available are sex(1 for male and 2 for female), city (110 cities), age (0 to 100 years), time (2012 to 2018), and the labels (target variable) is the corresponding population.

The most recent data (2018) is used as test set.

This represents a naive approach to data analysis, with the purpose of learning how to build simple tensorflow models and feed them with real data, therefore it is not complete in the result visualization part and it has a low accuracy (predicts using a brute force approach, which doesn't take as starting point the previous year population).
